## Introduction 

According to Wikipedia, [Life Expectancy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_expectancy), is a statistical measure of the average time an organism is expected to live, based on the year of its birth, its current age, and other demographic factors including biological sex. The most used measure is life expectancy at birth (LEB). Life expectancy is a key metric for assessing population health and telling the average age of death in a population. It is one of the factors in measuring the Human Development Index (HDI) of each nation along with adult literacy, education, and standard of living. Understanding the key forms of life expectancy like Health Life Expectancy at birth (HALE) and Life Expectancy at birth (LEB) have been important tools not only for nations in improving their health care and social security schemes but have also helped corporates like insurance providers in assessing their cash outflows. But even today, there are great variations in life expectancy between different parts of the world, mostly caused by differences in public health, medical care, and diet.

The purpose of this project was to understand what Life Expectancy at birth (LEB) is and how is it distributed across the world. Aggregation and groupings were used to estimate the trends in Life expectancies over a period, and what factors influence it. Machine Learning (ML) algorithms were used to analyze Life Expectancy and its relationship with other factors like BMI, Alcohol consumption, Schooling, Adult Mortality etc. Supervised ML techniques like Linear Regression were used to make predictions about life expectancies. To evaluate different regression models, error metrics like Mean Squared Error, Mean Absolute Percentage Error were used as they summarized how close predictions were to their expected values along with the coefficient of determination (R-squared) score to compare model performance. Finally, scikit-learn was integrated with Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries to visualize these metrics, model coefficients and forecast errors from different models and choose the model that best predicts Life expectancies from the dataset.
